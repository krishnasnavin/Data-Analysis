# Data Analysis Project 

This project involves an in-depth analysis of the dataset to derive insights and visualize trends. The primary objective was to clean, preprocess, and analyze the data using Python's powerful data analysis libraries.
 
## Features  
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, duplicates, and outliers.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Generating descriptive statistics and visualizations.  
- **Insights Extraction**: Identifying key patterns and trends in the data.  
- **Visualization**: Creating interactive and static visualizations using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.  

## Technologies and Libraries  
- **Python**  
- **Pandas**  
- **NumPy**  
- **Matplotlib**  
- **Seaborn**
